            What are his super powers? 
    </h2>
    <p>
         Spider-man has super strength and spider-like abilities. He can easily climb most anything including glass walls or tall buildings. He has "spider-sense" that alerts him to enemies or danger. He also can shoot spider webs from his wrist allowing him to create webs to trap criminals, grab items from a distance, and swing from building to building. 
    </p>
    <h2> How did Spider-man get his powers? </h2>
    <p> Peter Parker was on a school field trip to a science lab when he was bitten by a radioactive spider. The next day he woke up with spider powers. It took Peter some time to figure out all his powers and what to do with them. First he wanted to get revenge on those who killed his Uncle Ben. Later, he remembers his Uncle's words "with great power comes great responsibility" and he decides to use his powers for good to protect the people of New York from crime. He also designed the Spider-man costume to protect his identity. 
    </p>
    <h2>
            Who is Spider-man's alter ego? 
    </h2>
    <p>
            Teenager Peter Parker is Spider-man's alter ego. Peter works as an independent photographer for the Daily Bugle newspaper trying to help his Aunt May pay the bills. His boss at the newspaper, J. Jonah Jameson, does not like Spider-man and is out to discover his identity. Peter Parker falls in love with Mary Jane Watson. 
    </p>
    <h2>
            Who are Spider-man's enemies? 
    </h2>
    <p>
            Spider-man has had a number of enemies he must defeat over the years. Like Spider-man, most of his enemies gain powers as the result of scientific accidents or experiments gone wrong. Some of his most notorious enemies include the Green Goblin, Dr. Octopus, the Chameleon, Kingpin, the Sandman, Venom, and the Scorpion.
